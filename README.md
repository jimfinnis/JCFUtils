# JCFUtils
Minecraft general utils, mainly for my own use. Also serves as a template for
other bukkit plugins.

## The template branch
This branch can be checked out to form the base of a new plugin. It only has
one command ("help") - see the Plugin.java file to see how new commands are
added with annonations.
All commands are subcommands of /jcfutils (aliased to /jcf), so to run the
help command do "/jcf help".
